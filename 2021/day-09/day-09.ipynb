    "<h2>--- Day 9: Smoke Basin ---</h2><p>These caves seem to be <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lava_tube\" target=\"_blank\">lava tubes</a>. Parts are even still volcanically active; small hydrothermal vents release smoke into the caves that slowly <span title=\"This was originally going to be a puzzle about watersheds, but we're already under water.\">settles like rain</span>.</p>\n",
    "<p>If you can model how the smoke flows through the caves, you might be able to avoid it and be that much safer. The submarine generates a heightmap of the floor of the nearby caves for you (your puzzle input).</p>\n",
    "<p>Smoke flows to the lowest point of the area it's in. For example, consider the following heightmap:</p>\n",
    "<pre><code>2<em>1</em>9994321<em>0</em>\n",
    "3987894921\n",
    "98<em>5</em>6789892\n",
    "8767896789\n",
    "989996<em>5</em>678\n",
    "</code></pre>\n",
    "<p>Each number corresponds to the height of a particular location, where <code>9</code> is the highest and <code>0</code> is the lowest a location can be.</p>\n",
    "<p>Your first goal is to find the <em>low points</em> - the locations that are lower than any of its adjacent locations. Most locations have four adjacent locations (up, down, left, and right); locations on the edge or corner of the map have three or two adjacent locations, respectively. (Diagonal locations do not count as adjacent.)</p>\n",
    "<p>In the above example, there are <em>four</em> low points, all highlighted: two are in the first row (a <code>1</code> and a <code>0</code>), one is in the third row (a <code>5</code>), and one is in the bottom row (also a <code>5</code>). All other locations on the heightmap have some lower adjacent location, and so are not low points.</p>\n",
    "<p>The <em>risk level</em> of a low point is <em>1 plus its height</em>. In the above example, the risk levels of the low points are <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>6</code>, and <code>6</code>. The sum of the risk levels of all low points in the heightmap is therefore <code><em>15</em></code>.</p>\n",
    "<p>Find all of the low points on your heightmap. <em>What is the sum of the risk levels of all low points on your heightmap?</em></p>"
